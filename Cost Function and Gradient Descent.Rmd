This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

n     <- 200 # number of observations
bias  <- 4
slope <- 3.5
dot   <- `%*%` # defined for personal preference 

x   <- rnorm(n) * 2
x_b <- cbind(x, rep(1, n))
y   <- bias + slope * x + rnorm(n)
df  <- data_frame(x = x,  y = y)

learning_rate <- 0.05
n_iterations  <- 100
theta         <- matrix(c(20, 20))

b0    <- vector("numeric", length = n_iterations)
b1    <- vector("numeric", length = n_iterations)
sse_i <- vector("numeric", length = n_iterations)
```



```{r}
for (iteration in seq_len(n_iterations)) { 
  yhat               <- dot(x_b, theta)          # predict using weights in theta
  residuals_b        <- yhat - y                 # calculate the residuals
  gradients          <- 2/n * dot(t(x_b), residuals_b) # calculate the gradients of MSE w.r.t model weights 
  theta              <- theta - learning_rate * gradients # update theta 
  
  sse_i[[iteration]] <- sum((y - dot(x_b, theta))**2)
  b0[[iteration]]    <- theta[2]
  b1[[iteration]]    <- theta[1]
  
}

model_i <- data.frame(model_iter = 1:n_iterations, 
                      sse = sse_i, 
                      b0 = b0, 
                      b1 = b1)


```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
